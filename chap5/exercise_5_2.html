<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new 
cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> 
cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed 
in plastic) into a water bath that is <em>precisely</em> 
set to the target temperature you want the food 
to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, 
Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature 
poaching.</q></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <i>Sous Vide Salmon</i> 
with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef 
table, contact us before <time>November 30.</time></p>

pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have 
immunity issues.</p></small>
